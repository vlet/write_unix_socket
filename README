write_unix_socket   is a tiny program that simply writes data
                    from STDIN to UNIX socket (SOCK_DGRAM)

For example, it is useful for snmptrapd as traphandle program to write
snmp traps into unix socket (to feed some daemon listen that socket)

JFYI, it's runs 30-times faster than same program written in perl, so
it's can be used on systems with big snmp traps traffic
